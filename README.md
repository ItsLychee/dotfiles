# nix config

this is my nix config, may not be the most complicated one around, but I come to think it's modular enough for me
to interchangeably use throughout itself.

## todo list
- eventually set up disk encryption
- integrate agenix with my configuration more
- harden my configuration as humanely possible while retaining convenience
- become better acquainted with the Nix ecosystem
- create the ultimate configuration for myself
