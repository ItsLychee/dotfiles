my nixos configuration, designed with multi-user and multi-host in mind, as I
value extensibility.

## hosts
- `hosts/hearth` -  main computer
- `hosts/hellfire` - raspberry pi
- `hosts/iso` - multi-arch ISO image
- `hosts/wirescloud` - hetzner server instance
- `hosts/pathway` - 2nd laptop that I have ever had, it served a significant role in me getting into software dev!

## acknowledgements

I drew inspiration from these users, no matter how big or small
it was.

These configurations taught me the importance of the module system and how it can be used
to your advantage, you can look at the other branches in the repository and you will see the difference :D
