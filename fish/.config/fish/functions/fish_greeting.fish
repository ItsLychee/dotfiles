It was a beautiful Wednesday afternoon when I met le fishe, his eye's were the most amazing thing I 
have ever seen. The way he moved with that...that sway, as if he were dancing to the beat of life. He swam 
up to me, and said \" oh he he oi oi, doo yoo wane bee mayne\" tears of joy dripping down my my face, \"I say yes le fishe\" 
and we ate croissants in the moonlight. 

It was a beautiful Wednesday afternoon when I met le fishe, and a day I'll never forget
