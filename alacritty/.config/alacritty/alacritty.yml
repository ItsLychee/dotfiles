# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing

# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

# Font configuration
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face
  normal:
    family: Misc Termsyn
  bold:
    family: Misc Termsyn
  italic:
    family: Misc Termsyn
  
  size: 8

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought
  # of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
  # spacing.
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the
  # right, increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`.
  #use_thin_strokes: true

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
# draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: false
