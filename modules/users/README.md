# My own home management

I did this for a couple of good reasons:


1. HM is quite oriented towards the use of using HM modules to configure programs, I'm
quite aware that I don't have to use options and I could simply just use `home.packages` for
wrappers, but I wanted to take advantage of this by making it a learning opportunity for
me to grow and potentially give back to the Nix ecosystem.

2. Gives the `hey` option attrset uniqueness
3. It looks like a fun mini-project
4. FUN!!
